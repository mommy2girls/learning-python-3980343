# Sequences: Lists and Tuples
# These are -- surprise -- sequences of values
mylist = [0, 1, "two", 3.2, False]
# print(len(mylist))

# to access a member of a sequence type, use []
# print(mylist[2])
# print(mylist[-1])
# mylist[0] = 10
# print(mylist)


# add a list to another list
# another_list = [6, 7, 8]
# mylist = mylist + another_list
# print(mylist)

# mystr = "This is a string"
# print(mystr[2])


# use slices to get parts of a sequence
# print(mylist[1:4:2])
# print(mylist[::2])

# you can use slices to reverse a sequence
# print(mylist[::-1])

# Tuples are like lists, but they are immutable(they can't be changed)
mytuple = (0,1,2,"three")
print(mytuple[1])

# Sets are also sequences, but they contain unique values
# myset = {1, 2, 3, 2, 4, "hey"} will give {1, 2, 3, 4, 'hey'}
# print(myset) will give {1, 2, 3, 4, 'hey'}


# Set, however, can not be indexed like lists or tuples
# print(myset[0]) # this will cause an error

# Test for membership
print(1 in mylist)
print(3 in mytuple)
print(5 in myset)

# will give True, False, False
